My PC suddenly broke down a few weeks ago. Even though it was six years old, this was quite unexpected and kind of annoying. The main problem was that my PC would turn on, the RGB on the motherboard would glow, but I wouldn't get any display output. Simple problem, the GPU died. I ordered a new GPU (an Intel Arc B580 I was eyeing already) and waited till the next day for it to arrive.

The next day, I installed the new GPU, booted the PC up and... Still nothing. Seems like it isn't a GPU issue. I tried swapping PCI slots, but nothing worked. I dreaded this already, as I do _have_ an extra AM4 CPU, but it was installed in my NAS. Because I was out of options, I took out the CPU, installed it and the display turned on. Nothing else seemed broken and my boot drive was also working.

## Fixing or rebuilding

Well, this caused me to debate just swapping out the old AM4 CPU, which would cost me about â‚¬50, and have me up and running.
