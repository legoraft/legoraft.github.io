I recently was forced to upgrade my PC, because its CPU broke. I went for a fully new system, as my old one was 6 years old and I wanted to move to a new platform (most notably AM5). Because I didn't want to break the bank, I went with an Intel B580, because it seems to be the best bang-for-buck GPU. It is a great GPU, but it still has some issues. This is just the fact for early adopters of this tech. I want to dive in some of the good bad and ugly for Intel GPUs on Linux.
